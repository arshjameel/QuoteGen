# QuoteGen

## Description
A sister app of [TweetGen](https://github.com/arshjameel/TweetGen). 

The original program was modified to provide tweets from a number of preset Twitter accounts. It allows the program to behave as an FYP where you get your favourite accounts' most recent tweets.

## Installation
In order to use this program we need the [ntscraper](https://github.com/bocchilorenzo/ntscraper) library.

To install ntscraper:
```
pip install ntscraper
```

## How to use
to run this program you have to clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/arshjameel/QuoteGen.git
cd QuoteGen
```
Then:
```
python .\quotegen.py
```

## How to modify
Look for this block of code in line 41.

Change the Twitter handles specified within the quotes to any other Twitter handle you prefer to follow.

## Notes
Please visit the [TweetGen](https://github.com/arshjameel/TweetGen) repository for more information, since this app is the same except for some minor changes that allowed me to preset specific Twitter accounts.
